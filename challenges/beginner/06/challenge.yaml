title: "Wild Card Search: LIKE and Pattern Matching"
description: |
  Sometimes you need to find Pokemon with similar characteristics or names that follow a pattern. That's where the LIKE operator comes in - it's like using a special detector to find Pokemon that share certain traits!
  
  The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column. There are two wildcards used in conjunction with LIKE:
  
  - % (percent sign): Represents zero, one, or multiple characters
  - _ (underscore): Represents a single character
  
  Basic syntax:
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name
  WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;
  ```
  
  Examples:
  - Find Pokemon whose names start with 'Char':
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM pokemon WHERE name LIKE 'Char%';
    ```
    This would match Charmander, Charmeleon, Charizard.
  
  - Find Pokemon whose names end with 'chu':
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM pokemon WHERE name LIKE '%chu';
    ```
    This would match Pikachu, Raichu.
  
  - Find Pokemon whose names have 'saur' anywhere in them:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM pokemon WHERE name LIKE '%saur%';
    ```
    This would match Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, Venusaur.
  
  - Find Pokemon with exactly 5 letters in their name:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM pokemon WHERE name LIKE '_____';
    ```
    This would match names like Abra, Mew, etc.

  task: |
    Professor Oak is looking for Pokemon with specific naming patterns for his research! Write a query to find all Pokemon whose names:
    
    - End with the letters "chu" (like Pikachu, Raichu)
    OR
    - Contain the word "saur" anywhere in their name (like Bulbasaur, Venusaur)
    
    Return the pokemon_id, name, and type columns.
  
  expected_columns:
    - "pokemon_id"
    - "name"
    - "type"
  
  validation:
    type: "result_set"
    file: "solution.sql"
  
  hints:
    - "Use the LIKE operator with the % wildcard to find patterns in names."
    - "For Pokemon ending with 'chu', use name LIKE '%chu'"
    - "For Pokemon containing 'saur', use name LIKE '%saur%'"
    - "Combine these conditions with the OR operator."
