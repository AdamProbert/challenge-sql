title: "Range Selection: BETWEEN and IN"
description: |
  A skilled Pokemon Trainer needs to quickly find Pokemon within specific ranges or sets of values. The BETWEEN and IN operators are perfect tools for this task - like using your Pokedex to find Pokemon with CP in a certain range or belonging to specific types!
  
  The BETWEEN operator selects values within a given range (inclusive), while the IN operator allows you to specify multiple possible values for a column.
  
  Basic syntax for BETWEEN:
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name
  WHERE columnN BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
  ```
  
  Basic syntax for IN:
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name
  WHERE columnN IN (value1, value2, ...);
  ```
  
  Examples:
  - Find Pokemon with CP between 1000 and 1500:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM pokemon WHERE cp BETWEEN 1000 AND 1500;
    ```
  
  - Find Pokemon that are either Fire, Water, or Grass type:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM pokemon WHERE type IN ('Fire', 'Water', 'Grass');
    ```
  
  These operators help write cleaner, more concise queries compared to using multiple OR conditions.

  task: |
    Professor Oak is studying starter Pokemon and their evolutions! Write a query to find all Pokemon that match BOTH of these criteria:
    
    1. Have CP values BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000 (inclusive)
    2. Are one of the following types: 'Fire', 'Water', or 'Grass'
    
    Return the pokemon_id, name, type, and cp columns ordered by type and then by CP in descending order.
  
  expected_columns:
    - "pokemon_id"
    - "name"
    - "type"
    - "cp"
  
  validation:
    type: "result_set"
    file: "solution.sql"
  
  hints:
    - "Use the BETWEEN operator to find Pokemon with CP between 1000 and 2000."
    - "Use the IN operator to find Pokemon that are Fire, Water, or Grass type."
    - "Combine both conditions with the AND operator."
    - "Remember to order the results by type first and then by CP in descending order."
