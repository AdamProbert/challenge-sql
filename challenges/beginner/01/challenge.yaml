title: "Gotta Query 'Em All: Your First SELECT Statement"
description: |
  Welcome to your first SQL challenge! SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language designed to interact with databases, and today you'll be starting your journey as a Pokémon Database Trainer!
  
  In this challenge, you'll learn the most fundamental SQL command: SELECT. The SELECT statement allows you to retrieve data from a database, just like using your Pokédex to identify Pokémon.
  
  The basic syntax is:
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name;
  ```
  
  If you want to select all columns, you can use the asterisk (*):
  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM table_name;
  ```
