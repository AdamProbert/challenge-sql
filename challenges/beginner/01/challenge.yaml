title: "Gotta Query 'Em All: Your First SELECT Statement"
description: |
  Welcome to your first SQL challenge in the Pokemon SQL PokeDex! SQL (Structured Query Language) 
  is the language used by Pokemon Professors worldwide to interact with their Pokemon databases.
  Today, you'll take your first steps as a Pokemon Database Trainer!
  
  In this challenge, you'll learn the most fundamental SQL command: SELECT. The SELECT statement 
  allows you to retrieve data from a database, just like using your Pokedex to identify Pokemon.
  
  The basic syntax is:
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name;
  ```
  
  If you want to select all columns, you can use the asterisk (*):
  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM table_name;
  ```
