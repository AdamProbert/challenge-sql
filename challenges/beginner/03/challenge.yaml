title: "Advanced Pokemon Filtering: AND, OR, and NOT"
description: |
  As a skilled Pokemon Trainer, you need to be able to filter your Pokemon database with more precision. 
  In this challenge, you'll learn how to combine multiple conditions using logical operators 
  AND, OR, and NOT to create more complex filters in your Pokedex.
  
  The logical operators work like this:
  
  - AND: Both conditions must be true (like catching a Pokemon that is BOTH Electric type AND from Kanto)
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM pokemon WHERE type = 'Electric' AND region = 'Kanto';
  ```
  
  - OR: At least one condition must be true (like finding Pokemon that are EITHER Electric OR Water type)
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM pokemon WHERE type = 'Electric' OR type = 'Water';
  ```
  
  - NOT: Inverts a condition (like finding all Pokemon that are NOT Fire type)
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM pokemon WHERE NOT type = 'Fire';
  ```
  
  You can also use parentheses to combine these operators for more complex conditions, just like in mathematics.

  task: |
    Professor Oak needs to find specific Pokemon for his research! Write a query to select all Pokemon
    that are either Electric-type OR Water-type, but ONLY those with CP greater than 1000.
    
    Return the pokemon_id, name, type, and cp columns.
  
  expected_columns:
    - "pokemon_id"
    - "name"
    - "type"
    - "cp"
  
  validation:
    type: "result_set"
    file: "solution.sql"
  
  hints:
    - "Use the OR operator to combine the type conditions (type = 'Electric' OR type = 'Water')"
    - "Use the AND operator to add the CP condition (... AND cp > 1000)"
    - "You may need parentheses to ensure the correct operator precedence: WHERE (condition1 OR condition2) AND condition3"
