title: "Pokemon Filter: Using the WHERE Clause"
description: |
  Now that you know how to retrieve Pokemon data with SELECT, it's time to level up your SQL skills! 
  Let's learn how to filter results using the WHERE clause, just like how a Pokedex can filter Pokemon 
  by type or region.
  
  The WHERE clause allows you to specify conditions that must be met for a row to be included 
  in the result set. This is essential for finding specific Pokemon in your database.
  
  Basic syntax:
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition;
  ```
  
  Common operators used in WHERE conditions:
  - Equal to: =  (Is this Pokemon Pikachu?)
  - Greater than: >  (Is their HP over 100?)
  - Less than: <  (Is their weight under 10kg?)
  - Greater than or equal to: >=  (CP at least 1000?)
  - Less than or equal to: <=  (Level at most 50?)
  - Not equal to: <> or !=  (Not Electric type?)
  - LIKE: Pattern matching with wildcard characters (% and _)  (Names starting with 'P'?)

    Professor Oak needs your help! Write a query that selects all columns from the 'pokemon' table
    where the 'type' is 'Electric'.
  
  expected_columns:
    - "pokemon_id"
    - "pokemon_name"
    - "type"
    - "region"
    - "hp"
    - "first_appearance"
  
  validation:
    type: "result_set"
    file: "solution.sql"
  
  hints:
    - "Use the WHERE clause to filter records, just like using a Pokedex to find specific Pokemon!"
    - "The condition should check if the type column equals 'Electric'."
    - "Remember that string values in SQL need to be in quotes, like 'Electric'."
