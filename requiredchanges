Feedback:
- Too much content per challenge.
  - SPlit into, the tutorial and the challenge. All on one page is too much.

- Stick with just pokemon, lets make the whole thing themed around a pokedex.

- Can't navigate back a line in the interactive terminal. Once enter is pressed once, thats it.

- Supply a semicolon if the user didn't. This is a common mistake and should be handled.

- Highlight the Task easier using H in markdown. The challenge heading is good for this.

- Capture ctrl+c and handle nicely.

- Double enter is weird.. work it out. option: if semicolon is present, one enter will submit. Can't submit sql queries without semicolon.

- Auto continue when enter pressed after success, instead of having to enter Y.
